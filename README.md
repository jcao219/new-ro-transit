# New Ro Transit Website

A website dedicated to providing information about transit options in New Rochelle. The goal is to help potential new residents and current inhabitants make the most of the city's transit system.

## Future Goals

Our forward-looking objective is to incorporate dynamic content that helps people decide to move to New Rochelle, or assists current residents in taking full advantage of the transit options available.

## Getting Started

This project is built using Fresh (a Deno framework).

1.  **Ensure Deno is installed.** If not, follow the instructions at [https://deno.land/#installation](https://deno.land/#installation).
2.  **Clone the repository.**
3.  **Navigate to the project directory.**
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    deno task start
    ```
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

This command is usually defined in the `deno.json` file and might run a script like `dev.ts`.
